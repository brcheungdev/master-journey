- ## ⚪ Lecture Content 讲座内容
- ### 1. Computer System Hierarchy  计算机系统层次结构
1. Application Level  
2. High-level Language Level  
3. Machine Instruction Level (with OS)  
4. Register Transfer Level  
5. Gate Level (Logic Design)  
6. Device Level (MOS Device Design)

 - **Software Layers**: Application, High-level Language, OS, Machine Instructions  软件层
 - **Hardware Layers**: Register Transfer, Gate, Device Levels                      硬件层
 - OS acts as a bridge between software and hardware

### 2. Applications of Computers  计算机的应用
- **Numerical Simulation**: Structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics  
- **Big Data**: Data mining, neural networks, forecasting  
- **Business Systems**: ERP, banking, reservations  
- **Multimedia**: Games, VR, visualization  
- **AI & Robotics**: Image/speech understanding, industrial & medical robots  
- **Internet & IoT**: Online services, smart cities

### 3. Programming Languages
- **Procedural Languages**: C, C++, Java, Python, Fortran, COBOL  
- **Declarative Languages**: SQL, Haskell, Prolog  
- **General-purpose vs Domain-specific** languages  
- **Compiled vs Interpreted** approaches  
  - *Compiler*: Analyze entire source → generate machine code → execute  
  - *Interpreter*: Execute line by line → easier debugging but slower

 ### 4. C Programming Basics
- Why learn C:
  - Close to hardware  
  - OS and device-level programming  
  - Good for understanding system internals  
- Example: **Hello World!** Program
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void) {
      printf("Hello World!\n");
      return 0;
  }
