# 🎓 master-journey

Learning, practice, and research projects from my master's program in Applied Information Technology.

[中文](./READMEzh.md) | [日本語（準備中）]

<h2></h2>

## After several years of study, my student life has temporarily come to an end.  This is my first time documenting my journey here on GitHub.

This repository contains insights, code examples, demos, and reflections from my master's program —  
serving as both a summary of my work and a reminder to continue learning and growing.

##  About My Master's Program

- **Degree**: Master of Science in Information Technology (MS in IT)  
- **University**: Kyoto College of Graduate Studies for Informatics (KCGI)  
- **Major**: Applied Information Technology  
- **GPA**: 3.58 / 4.0  
- **Research Topic**:  
  *AI-based adaptive adjustment strategies for online map services with multiple providers using reinforcement learning*

During my studies, I mainly focused on **Artificial Intelligence** and **Web System Development**,  
culminating in a research project on adaptive optimization strategies for multi-provider online map services using **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**.

In 2023, I was selected to represent KCGI and participated in the **UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF) 2023 Academic Projects**.
